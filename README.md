This Power BI dashboard analyzes customer attrition at Databel, a customer-centric mobile provider, to uncover the primary drivers of churn. 
By transforming raw customer data into actionable insights, the analysis reveals significant correlations between churn rates and five key 
factors: competitor activity, contract structure, demographics (age), plan types, and international calling patterns.

To mitigate these losses, Databel should benchmark its pricing and device quality against the competition to identify areas for improvement. 
Furthermore, the company should focus on long-term value by incentivizing customers to migrate toward plan types historically associated 
with higher retention.
